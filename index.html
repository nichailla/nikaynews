                    <h4>Dry season is here: PAGASA</h4>
                    <p>
                        MANILA — The state weather bureau declared Wednesday the start of the warm and dry season in the Philippines.

PAGASA said in a release that the shift of wind direction over the Northwestern Pacific signaled the end of the northeast monsoon or amihan over most parts of the country and the start of the dry season. 

It added however that the Luzon's northern tip could still experience occasional northeasterly winds. 

"With this development, the day-to-day weather across the country will gradually become warmer, though isolated thunderstorms are also likely to occur," the weather bureau said.
It advised the public to take precautionary measures to minimize heat stress and to conserve water, as the resource usually becomes scarce during the period due to less rainfall.

The hot dry season in the Philippines typically occurs from March to May, while the cool dry season lasts from December to February.</p>

                    <h4>Miami Open: Philippines’ Alexandra Eala stuns Iga Swiatek with biggest win of career
                    </h4>
                    <p>Philippine wild card Alexandra Eala pulled off the biggest win of her young career with a stunning 6-2, 7-5 upset of Polish world No 2 Iga Swiatek to extend her dream run at the Miami Open into the semi-finals.

                        The big-hitting 19-year-old showed no signs of intimidation playing against one of her idols on Wednesday and was instead a picture of poise as she dismantled Swiatek’s serve early on to grab control of the match and never looked back.
                        
                        “I don’t know what to say, I mean, complete just disbelief right now and I am on cloud nine,” said Eala, ranked 140th in the world, in her on-court interview. “It’s forever in my heart.”
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        Eala had already become the first Philippine woman to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament. She will now face a semi-final against the winner of American fourth seed Jessica Pegula and 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu of Britain.

                    <h4>The Globalization of Philippine Political Trolling</h4>
                    <p>On March 11, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested under a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC). He faces charges of crimes against humanity related to his violent “war on drugs,” which led to the killings of thousands without trial. The arrest has created an immediate controversy in the Philippines. The Facebook comments section of a post by BBC News reporting the news quickly became a battleground, with responses ranging from calls for justice – “Jail and let Duterte pay for his crimes!!” one user commented – to claims that the arrest was “illegal” or part of a conspiracy.

                        Within a week, the post had amassed over 3,000 comments. It was not an isolated case. Hundreds of Facebook posts by news outlets and individuals alike have been overwhelmed with debates, disinformation, and conspiracy theories – manifestations of the online political trolling that became a hallmark of Duterte’s presidency. During his time in power (2016–2022), his supporters utilized digital harassment to discredit opponents, spread misinformation, and target journalists, activists, and political figures. Now, these same tactics are likely to be turned against global leaders, ICC prosecutors and judges, and news organizations covering the case. While such interactions once mainly occurred on Philippine social media, they have now spread globally, as Duterte’s arrest has gained international attention.</p>
